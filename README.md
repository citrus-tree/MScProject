# MScProject

This project, submitted as part of my MSc, examines two existing techniques for the real-time rendering of coloured shadow casters using shadow mapping techniques (no ray-tracing), as well as introduces a new technique which address the weaknesses of both existing techniques.

The full report is available as a <a href="https://github.com/citrus-tree/MScProject/blob/dev/report/Modisett%20MSc%20Project.docx">Word document</a> and <a href="https://github.com/citrus-tree/MScProject/blob/dev/report/Modisett%20MSc%20Project.pdf">PDF</a> in the report directory.

The above images compares the two existing techniques examined with the newly introduced technique, composited translucent shadows.
